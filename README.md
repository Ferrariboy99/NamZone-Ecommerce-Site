# NamZone Commerce Experience

NamZone has evolved from a PHP-powered marketplace into a modern, component-driven React platform. The refreshed experience is built with TypeScript and Vite, delivering a fast, immersive, and mobile-first storefront for discovering elevated second-hand and lifestyle products.

## UI preview

> Previous PHP screenshots remain in the `Screenshots/` directory for archival purposes. Launch the development server to explore the redesigned interface interactively.

---

## Tech stack

- **React 18** with **TypeScript** for a type-safe component architecture
- **Vite** for lightning-fast local development and optimized builds
- **React Router** for client-side routing between storefront, cart, and account flows
- Modern CSS with custom gradients, glassmorphism, and responsive grid layouts

---

## Getting started

1. Ensure you have **Node.js 18+** installed.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Build for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

The original PHP codebase remains in the repository for reference but is no longer required to preview the new front-end experience.

## Legacy reference

Looking for the previous PHP implementation? Core assets remain untouched in the repository root, including:

- Admin panel and authentication flows under `admin/`
- PHP endpoints for catalog and cart operations
- SQL scripts inside `database/`
